# E-Commerce-Website
I developed a responsive and user-friendly eCommerce website using HTML and CSS to showcase products in an attractive layout. This project demonstrates key front-end web development skills, including:

Homepage with Banner – A visually appealing landing section featuring a call-to-action.

Product Listings – Grid layout of items with images, descriptions, and prices.

Navigation Bar – Fixed, responsive navbar with links to Home, Shop, About, and Contact pages.

Responsive Design – Fully optimized for mobile, tablet, and desktop views using media queries.

Footer Section – Includes contact info, quick links, and social media icons.

This project helped me strengthen my skills in layout structuring, design aesthetics, and building static web pages that simulate real-world online shopping platforms.
